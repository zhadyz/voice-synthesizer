# Mission Context - Voice Cloning & Conversion System

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13

## Current Mission
Build an intelligent voice cloning and conversion system that transforms any audio content into the user's voice.

**Vision**: User uploads their voice recording (training data), then uploads any target audio (e.g., Michael Jackson singing), and the system outputs that content in the user's cloned voice.

## Phase
**Phase 1 of 5: Research & Foundation**

## Active Objectives
1. [IN PROGRESS] Research state-of-the-art voice conversion/cloning techniques
2. [TODO] Design system architecture (training pipeline + inference API)
3. [TODO] Implement voice cloning model (PyTorch)
4. [TODO] Build web interface for audio upload and processing
5. [TODO] Integrate real-time voice conversion

## Technical State
- **Type**: ML Audio Processing System
- **Domain**: Voice Conversion, Speech Synthesis, Zero-shot Voice Cloning
- **Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, torchaudio, librosa, FastAPI (backend), React (frontend)
- **Version**: 0.1.0
- **Key Technologies**:
  - Voice conversion models (RVC, So-VITS-SVC, or similar)
  - Audio feature extraction (mel-spectrograms, embeddings)
  - Neural vocoders (HiFi-GAN, WaveGlow)

## Technical Requirements
- High-quality audio I/O (MP3, WAV support)
- Voice embedding extraction from user recordings
- Real-time or near-real-time inference
- Web-based upload interface
- Model training pipeline for custom voices

## Blockers
None currently

## Next Priorities
1. Research leading voice cloning architectures (RVC, So-VITS-SVC, YourTTS, etc.)
2. Evaluate pre-trained models vs. training from scratch
3. Define system architecture (training + inference pipelines)
4. Set up Python/PyTorch environment with audio libraries
