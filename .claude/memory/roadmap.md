# Strategic Roadmap - Voice Cloning System

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13

## Vision
Build an intelligent voice cloning and conversion system that allows users to transform any audio content into their own voice with minimal training data.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Research & Foundation [CURRENT]
**Goal**: Understand the landscape and establish technical foundation
- Research state-of-the-art voice conversion models
- Evaluate existing solutions (RVC, So-VITS-SVC, YourTTS, Coqui TTS)
- Design system architecture
- Set up development environment
- Prototype core voice embedding extraction

### Phase 2: Core ML Pipeline [PLANNED]
**Goal**: Implement voice cloning model and training pipeline
- Implement voice encoder (speaker embedding extraction)
- Build or integrate voice conversion model (PyTorch)
- Create training pipeline for custom voices
- Implement neural vocoder for audio synthesis
- Validate model performance on test voices

### Phase 3: Web Application [PLANNED]
**Goal**: Build user-facing interface
- FastAPI backend for audio processing
- React frontend with drag-and-drop audio upload
- Real-time inference API
- Audio playback and download
- User voice profile management

### Phase 4: Production Deployment [PLANNED]
**Goal**: Deploy system with production-grade infrastructure
- Containerize application (Docker)
- Set up GPU-accelerated inference (CUDA/TensorRT)
- Implement audio preprocessing pipeline
- Deploy to cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- CI/CD pipeline for model updates

### Phase 5: Advanced Features [FUTURE]
**Goal**: Enhance capabilities and performance
- Multi-speaker voice cloning
- Emotion and prosody control
- Real-time streaming voice conversion
- Fine-tuning with user feedback
- Mobile app integration
